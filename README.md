# PerVerse
Procedural-Style Script
PerVerse is somewhat similar to FetLang- but with different approach and intent.  First of all, PerVerse is not restricted to object-oriented. Secondly, it's meant to be used as a precursor to potential candidates like Fetlang. In addition, PerVerse is more expressive than FetLang, in attempt to appeal to a broader public than otherwise targeted few.
